    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Paschal Peter Lutta. I’m a strategic thinker, philosopher, and systems engineer with an eye for deep mechanics behind societal, psychological, and physical structures. I built the philosophy of Preemptivitism, a framework exploring how systems predefine and manipulate outcomes through hidden mechanisms. I also work on time waveform models with my main aim being to prove that how we define, and think about time, is not inherently incorrect, but just parts of a bigger puzzle. Making references to work done by scientists such as Newton, Einstein, Kondrariev and Hamilton, I seek out to prove that time is not just a classical system, but a quantum entity. I am also responsible for creation of evaluatory frameworks, one of which to present as my final project, that introduce order in areas we initially thought were vague and full of chaos. These and other highly abstract projects are my way of contributing to the world, and I hope to inspire others to think deeply about the systems that govern our lives.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My interests lie in the intersection of philosophy, physics, and engineering. I am particularly fascinated by the hidden mechanisms that shape our reality and how we can use this understanding to create more efficient systems. I enjoy exploring complex ideas and finding ways to simplify them for practical applications. I am also interested in the ethical implications of technology and how we can use it to create a better world. My work is driven by a desire to understand the deeper structures of existence and to contribute to a more enlightened society.

    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles, mathematics, and physics, which I apply to my philosophical and strategic thinking. I have also engaged in various research projects that explore the intersection of these fields, allowing me to develop a unique perspective on complex systems.</p>

      <h3>1. Preemptivitism</h3>
      <p>
        Preemptivitism is a critical theory and philosophical system by which the world is seen neither as a chaotic sequence of accident and choice, but as an extremely malleable system governed by preemptive reason, predictive simulation, and dialectical assimilation. At its heart, Preemptivitism suggests that the major events of history, and perhaps even the intimate turns of individual lives, are not random, but part of a probabilistic architecture, designed to preserve systemic stability while giving the illusion of change, freedom, and evolution.

This philosophy is grounded in the notion that reality is constructed not only through the machinations of governments, media, and institutions but also through an overarching system that expects deviation, absorbs resistance, and self-corrects. Under this paradigm, innovation is never inherently liberatory and rebellion is rarely revolutionary; both are often subsumed by the logic of the system, made profitable or palatable and, therefore, harmless to the deeper structure. In fact, awakening itself, the very moment of clarity people claim to be liberated, is often the focal point, even the scripted step, leading up to it.

Preemptivitism relies heavily on Hegelian dialectics, systems theory, and contemporary behavioral modeling to assert that any thesis (overarching narrative) will spawn its antithesis (opponent force), and synthesis will be a scripted, preconceived reconciliation. The system here is not a disengaged observer but an engaged conductor, directing conflict and resolution for the purposes of sustaining a larger illusion of spontaneity and progress.

In this environment, the people are either lulled masses, soothed into inaction by convenience and distraction, or the primed few, who by chance or intent are tuned to the patterns hidden just below the surface. But even these few have their own dilemma: is what they know truly real, or just another layer of the architecture of the system , a part they were destined to play?

This is the deep ethical and psychological implications of Preemptivitism: if our thoughts, reactions, and even awakenings are foreseeable-or worse, pre-authorized-the pursuit of true agency becomes an exercise in the timing, subtlety, and awareness of escape instead of freedom. The Preemptive Thinker, then, does not seek to fight the system loudly, but to anticipate its next move, understand its rules, and exist within a thin space of uncharted possibility : where true disruption might still be possible.

Preemptivitism does not claim to hold all answers. Rather, it invites inquiry into the unseen architecture of modern life plus the rhythms behind revolutions, the timing of truths, and the strange feeling that even our resistance has been rehearsed. In a world governed by simulations of change and illusions of spontaneity, Preemptivitism offers a language to decode the script, and perhaps, write something of our own in the margins.

      <h3>2. The Prolonged Application Selection System ( P.A.S.S. )</h3>
      <p>
        PASS, or the Prolonged Application Selection System, is a precision-based evaluation system that is used to select the best fit for high-risk, research-based projects. Unlike lax or impression-based testing, PASS utilizes a mathematically grounded approach to measuring an individual's overall fit by evaluating their internal attributes as well as their expected value. The system has two primary pillars: Personal Commitment (PC) and Expected Value (EV), which both contribute 50% to the final score.

Personal Commitment component evaluates the qualities which decide the degree of trustworthiness and mental aptness of a person to be useful in long-term research work. It consists of six categories: Mathematical Strength, Physics Ability, Dependability, Mental Load, Work Ethic and Commitment, and Interest Level. These are scored individually, and their averages are utilized to give a PC score reflecting the inner potentiality of the candidate to live and thrive in intellectually challenging environments.

In contrast, Expected Value is a predictive measure—meant to approximate whether investment in the person is going to generate good returns or unnecessary expense. The latter encompasses four criteria: Potential Long-Term Value, Current Efficiency, Project Interference, and Learning Curve. The first two add value, while the last two detract from it. These are defined by an equation balanced between risk and gain: EV_initial = [(Long-Term Value + Current Efficiency) - (Interference + Learning Curve)] / 2. PASS supplements this with a dynamic modifier in the shape of a Resistance Index (RI), which normalizes the initial EV score. RI varies between 0.1 (max resistance) and 1 (no resistance), serving as a penalty or bonus depending on the degree to which the individual resists the process due to fear, insecurity, or lack of confidence. The EV then gets adjusted and is halved to yield EV_final.

The final PASS score is calculated by adding 50% of the PC score to the EV_final. This hybrid score gives an overall picture—balancing both what a candidate is currently giving and what it will cost to hire them. It stops high performers from being only those with potential but lacking resilience or commitment to make it work. The grading system is strict, with a minimum pass of 72.01% (C+), and below that point figures record levels of risk of from weak and unstable to obviously unsuitable for selection. PASS hence serves simultaneously as a screen and a forecast, eliminating guesswork from strategic recruitment and imposing standards by the rigidity of numbers.
Since the model was initially designed to accomodate candidates involved in departments that heavily rely on mathematics, physics and engineering, the current version of the model is not suitable for candidates in departments that do not heavily rely on these subjects. However, the model can be adapted to suit other departments by adjusting the criteria and weights assigned to each category.

      <h3>3. The Theory of Luminal Resistance </h3>
      <p>
       The Theory of Luminal Resistance is a new conceptual theory that challenges traditional assumptions about the nature of light, particularly the notion that light is totally weightless or resistance-free. Founded upon both particle physics and relativistic theory, this theory is based upon the postulate that in order for any object—either matter or energy—to travel at the speed of light, it would need to fulfill a set of extreme conditions, none of which are consistent with conventional mass-bearing particles. It is a consequence of Einstein's special relativity that nothing with rest mass can reach the speed of light because, as it accelerates, its relativistic mass approaches infinity, requiring infinite energy. Light, therefore, as massless in the classical sense, has been excluded traditionally from this limitation, treated instead as a special entity that just happens to be at that terminal velocity. However, the Theory of Luminal Resistance returns to this exemption not by denying the masslessness of the photon, but by proposing that the ability to sustain luminal velocity is not a sign of exemption from resistance, but a sign of a resistance system in a state of perfect equilibrium—a balance so exquisite that it cancels out any measurable inertia, yet remains structurally accountable to the quantum and spacetime fabric through which light moves.

The theory postulates that light, when it moves at 299,792,458 meters per second, does not do so unimpeded. Instead, its motion is determined by an innate resistance that is associated with the very fabric of spacetime—a thing inherent in the electromagnetic field interactions, quantum vacuum fluctuations, and geometry of energy-momentum exchange. Rather than the simple friction or drag in a mechanical sense, luminal resistance is proposed as a form of boundary condition—a threshold dynamic—that constrains what forms of energy can exist at or beyond the speed of light. It's not resistance in the sense of slowing down motion, but rather a more universal principle that closes the door to the luminal boundary and maintains the structural integrity of the speed of light as a cosmological speed limit. Within this view, photons are not immune to resistance but are the only particles that can interface with it flawlessly—like a dancer who steps with exactly the right rhythm to stroll through a storm without being contacted by it.

This theory also predicts that anything attempting to cross into luminal or superluminal motion runs into not just increasing energy demand, but a dissolution of its ontological coherence—the very principles governing its mass, time, and space begin to disintegrate. Thus, resistance at the luminal border is not just a physical one but a metaphysical principle—a boundary beyond which normal physics gets increasingly complex. The Theory of Luminal Resistance can also open up the re-description of phenomena like gravitational lensing, event horizons of black holes, and quantum tunneling, with a new way of thinking about how light is bent, escapes, or is trapped—not as anomalies but as expressions of resistance architecture.

In effect, the Theory of Luminal Resistance says that the movement of light is not an absence of resistance, but a waltz with it—a limit with the very outer structural constraints of the universe. It reimagines the photons not as massless exceptions, but as entities in perfect tension with the laws that constrain all motion. By recontextualizing our understanding of the special speed of light, the theory tries to bridge gaps between classical physics, quantum theory, and metaphysical speculation, suggesting that what we call "resistance" is not a force to be vanquished, but the very condition for possibility of existence at the speed of light.

      <h3>4. Conclusion </h3>
      <p>
       In conclusion, my work is a testament to the power of deep thinking and the importance of understanding the systems that govern our lives, as this is only but surface level. Through my projects, I aim to inspire others to think critically about the world around them and to explore the hidden mechanisms that shape our reality. Whether it is through the philosophy of Preemptivitism, the Prolonged Application Selection System, or the Theory of Luminal Resistance, I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities of existence and to encourage others to engage with these ideas in their own lives.
